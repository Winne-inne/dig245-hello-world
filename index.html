        <p>
            <b>I've</b> never really been intersted in computers and coding until I took Bioinformatics
            fall of sophmore year. Since then, I've been dabbling a bit in programming and interested
            in about the different branches of digital studies. Critical Web Design seemed like a good 
            way to get more knowledge on the interfaces and systems we use everyday. I hope to become 
            proficient enough to make websites of my own and other design work.

            <h2>Expirence?</h2>
        </head>
        <p>
            <b>Currently,</b> the only programming expirence I have is a little bit of python and a
            engine dependant language called Gscript. I'm really into making games and have made
            a few small one for now.

            <h2>Tutorial Summary</h2>
        </head>
        <p>
            <b>What</b> I've learned from the Keyboard shortcuts and Workflow tutorial is that workflow is necessary for successful coding. 
            A good workflow not only speeds up the progress but ensures that time is not wasted trying to operate between the many files
             and windows programming inevitably brings. Instead of searching for the file icon, looking for the save button, or going 
             across the screen to close a tab, there are commands on the keyboard that allow you to do all of that and more without having 
             to move your hands too much, leaving your flow uninterrupted.It's good to set up a good workflow and familiarity with keyboard 
             commands early in your coding endeavors to ensure success down the road.

            </ul>
            <b>I</b> instantly went to the color tab on the critical web design site becuase I just wanted
            to see what fun, crazy projects have been made taking advantage of color. And I was not 
            dissapointed. I have a cat at home and just like him, this website was a nice reminder of 
            taking it slow somtimes and finding entertainment in the flashy monotone.

            </ul>
            <b>I</b> then went to the game section because as aforementioned, game dev has been a new passion
            of mine. At first I wasn't sure how to play but this game was so fun in a tongue in cheek way.
            There was no way of winning yet that's what made it fun. As a former greek history fanatic,
            this was a fun design to explore.

            </ul>
            <b>And</b> finally, I went to the meditative tab. It was really cool to see this online kind of art exhbit.
            I've never been to a museum but this site gave me the feel of what I image an art museum would be 
            like. It was medatative in a kind of trippy way yet it also invoke a bit of feeling which I heard is 
            the goal of art.

            <h2>Hardest Part?</h2>
        </head>
        <p>
            <b>The</b> summary part, honestly. I'm not very good at summarizing. And I have a feeling getting this 
            onto github may be a little tricky for me too! But overall, this was good.
